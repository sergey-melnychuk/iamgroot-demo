========

Demo example of how results of OpenRPC stub generator can be used.

Start the server:

```
cargo run
```

Run the examples (against the running server):

```
cargo run --example rpc
```

### Notes
- The code in `generated` is generated by "the tool".
- User just needs to implement the `gen::Rpc` trait.
- All the matching/routing is happening in `gen::handle`.
- Library (not a framework) allows flexible usage:
  - Allows storing generated code in the VCS.
  - Allows generating stubs in build-time.
  - 100% transport/framework agnostic.
  - Idiomatic pure-Rust.
- No need to manually 'adjust' DTOs to any schema changes
